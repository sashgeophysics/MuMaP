# This file contains preprocessed seismic data from Ps receiver function
# Contents of the columns are
# Lat Lon 350 410  Rnorm dT0, dT1 .. dT8
# Lat =  Latitude
# Lon =  Longitude
# 350 => depth to the peak of the Low Velocity zone (in km)
# 410 => Depth to the top of the transition zone
# dT  => Temperature anomaly at each location in (K) calculated from
#        transition zone thickness
#        dT0...dT8 are temperature anomalies calculated for
#        values of Clapeyrone slopes starting from 0.5 MPa/K to 4.5 Mpa/K in
#        increments of 0.5 MPa/K
